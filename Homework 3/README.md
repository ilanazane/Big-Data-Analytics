# Task 1: 

- use glmfit function to get the logisitc regression coefficients 
- use the glmval function to get teh logistic regression probability vector 
- use the perfurve function to get the ROC curve and associated AUC value 

# Task 2: 

- split the predictor and response as two parts: training and validation 
- use the training set data to apply logistic regression 
  - plot the ROC curve with training response and then obtain the AUC value for training 
- apply the logistic regression coefficients from the training data set to the validation set 
  - plot the ROC curve with validation response and then obtain the AUC value for validation 
  
Discuss the difference between the training AUC value and the validation AUC value.
