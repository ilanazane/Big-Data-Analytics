In this homeowrk assignment we discussed whether the below statements were true or false: 

1) For a stationary AR(1) time series x(t), x(t) is uncorrelated to x(t-1) for l>=2 
2) For a stationary MA(1) time series x(t), you will observe the ACF values cliff after time lag l>=2 in the ACF plot 

For the last part of the assignment we found the best predictive model for a given time series using different techniques discussed in lecture
